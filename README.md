# SpeakbuddyTest
Test for Speakbuddy. I've implemented the screen and animation basically as shown in the mockup. I could spend some more time on pixel polish but need to timebox this a little.
* I've implemented using charts in SwiftUI, this is fairly recent so older versions of iOS will not be supported but I wanted to give this a go with the most modern tools that I could use.
* I've created a basic layout for landscape as well, this should work for most phones and ipad.
* I should maybe lock or alter some styles for dark theming but have not gotten to this yet.
* The colors were picked by hand so the gradients may be just a little off and the shadow on the button is just a little off.
* Overall this was a fun test, I don't really get much opportunity to work with SwiftUI or animations these days, mostly a lot of platform level architecture, I enjoyed this test a lot.
